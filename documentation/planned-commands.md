|   `A`   | `B<str> A<str>`        | `<str>`    | Splits `B` on `A`, sorts all parts in ascending order and joins the result back on `B`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|   `a`   | `C<str> B<str> A<cmd>` | `<str>`    | Splits `C` on `B` and sorts the parts ascending with the key calculated by `A`. `A` maps each part into one string which gets converted into an integer, removing non-digit characters before. This mapping string is obtained by joining the stack bottom to top. If no digit is found in this string, it's length is used as key. The sorted parts get joined back on `B`. |
